Temperature
Mechanics:
Temperature is an effect that only occurs in Expert or higher. And it is affected by many different things and sources.
Here is what effects it:
Time of day
Current weather
Climate where dungeon is located
Stepping on certain floor tiles
Being near certain floor tiles
Changing floors
Being attacked by certain types of moves.
Wearing armor.
Your type also affects temperature effects. For example, Fire type Pokémon are resistant to hot temperature changes.
Upon entering a floor, the temperature change value of the dungeon will be applied to the temperature of everyone on your team, (partners get that value applies less) with a portion of that value being applied every turn in VERY SMALL amounts. The main natural temperature change comes from switching floors.
Thresholds for temperature are as follows: 
Freezing: -25F
Chilled: 0F
Cold: 25F
Normal: 50F
Warm: 75F
Hot: 100F
Burning: 125F

Freezing: You will be inflicted with Hypothermia. Ice attacks will randomly inflict the Stasis debuff for 3-5 turns.
Chilled: You will be more susceptible to Ice type attacks
Cold: Nothing drastic.
Normal
Warm: Nothing drastic.
Hot: You will be more susceptible to Fire type attacks.
Burning: You will be inflicted with Hyperthermia. Fire attacks will set you On Fire (Ignited) instead of inflicting a Burn.

Type match ups can mitigate the effects of temperature. For example, Fire type Pokémon would resist Hypothermia as it deals ice damage.

Debuffs:
Hypothermia
You are frozen to the core. Every 5 turns you will take 2 HP of Ice damage.
Hyperthermia
You are burning to the core. Every 5 turns you will take 2 HP of Fire damage.
