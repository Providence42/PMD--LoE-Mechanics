~~ Units of the Corps of Angels:

~ Land:
Land is the Division responsable for exploring the landed areas of the world. Made up of 5 Regiments.
1st Regiment is comprised of a Foot Guard, a.k.a, the King's Guard. They are elite Angels made up of the best, and strongest of the Corps, and commanded by those who are exceptional leaders, and have a special role. Their main job is to guard the King, but they also serve as elite troops in the field. When push comes to shove and the normal regiments cant get it done, send in the King's Guard. Note, this is not used for exploring, that's what the other regiments are for. But if the King or the Prince of Angels needs something very important or something cannot be achieved with normal Angels, then the King's Guard gets sent in.
The other Regiments make up the "line-infantry" of the Angels and are mostly used for exploring different parts of the world, and exploring dungeons and such.
The 5th Regiment is the Police Regiment and makes up the day to day policing of the Sancuary.
