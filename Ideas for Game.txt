Ideas for game: Bold is done Italics is maybe done? Bug Fix Normal is not done
Add chests that can randomly spawn within dungeons (rare)
Add a exit to a secret location within dungeons
Add a secret cove (island) in lake spawns that has a chest.
Add a treasure trove room. This room is a rare spawn that can happen whenever you break one of the material spawns in a dungeon (tree, tree stump, rock, ore, etc). It spawns underneath the mining spawn. It is a stash of loot.
Add an endless dungeon but the wind limit keeps decreasing.
Implament slow movement speed
Add secret hidden rooms with goodies in free roam parts of game
Use an external JSON file to manageanimations for dungeon tile sets
Add areas around the game in "free play zones" that contain Life Fruits
Add storage things. Could be chests in house, or a sotrage box, idk rn.
Make it so moves are used based off of the Moves in structs system, not just created on the fly.
Add a sunburn mechanic with medicine to cure it
Add locked chests in dungeons
Make it so that pokemon defeated with status effects still give exp (99%)
Add an AI use type to moves
Make it so void damage does not kill?
Add a temperqatue mechanic with dungeon temperatures (RLCraft)
Add bloated enemies that drop some items that can be found in dungeons.
Add an item that can restore Mana like the Mana Flower in Terraria
Add a variant of Tresure Troves that contain an ambush
Add crumbling paths in ruins dungeons (like from terraria)
Add Adamantite as a material type? But the DND kind

Change how Strength, Resillience, and Intellegence work.:

	Wisdom: Extra Magic damage

	Strength: Normal Attack mult
	Resillience: Damage reduction
	Intellegence: Special Attack mult


Revamp external Pokemon format to include forms, gender ratios, drop rates
Switching spots takes up both's turns

For obj_DealDamage, maybe make that part of obj_effect. As in, make that it's parnet. That way, we can get the one by one damage thing easily. Of course, the system already has obj_DealDasmage but maybe for other stuff? IDK just an idea.
