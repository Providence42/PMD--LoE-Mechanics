~~ Mechanics:
Base Mechanics:
	All weapons in the game have a base power value.
	This power value can be added or subtracted by the material used.
	For example:
	A Longsword has:
		5 PWR
	Broze gives a +1 PWR...
	So a Bronze Longsword has:
		6 PWR
	
	Secondly, classes have unique weapons that only they can use. If other classes uses them then they suffer a penalty of:
		ACC -= 50
		PWR /= 2
		EXP /= 2
	However, there are classless weapons that suffer no penalty.
