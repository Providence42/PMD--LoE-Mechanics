		"The building itself was a large building with a massive facade, covered in windows.
		It was painted red, white, and gold, with a large emblem just above the two central doors.
		The emblem was a golden painted circle with wings coming out from either side.
		Two loops were situated just above and below the circle.
		There was an iridescent gem in the center of the circle shining the colors, red, green, and blue." (39)
